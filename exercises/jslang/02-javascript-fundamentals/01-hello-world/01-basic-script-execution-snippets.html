	<!-- ============ SNIPPET 1 ============ -->
	<!--
    Multiple <script> tags execute in document order, top to bottom.
    Each script block runs to completion before the next begins.
    Think about what order the console.log statements execute in.
  -->

	<script>
		// --- Snippet 1 ---
		console.log("A");
	</script>

	<p id="middle">Hello</p>

	<script>
		console.log("B");
		console.log(document.getElementById("middle").textContent);
		console.log("C");
	</script>

	<script>
		console.log("D");
	</script>

	<!--
    What is the full output, line by line?

    // YOUR ANSWER:
    // A
    // B
    // Hello
    // C
    // D
  -->


	<!-- ============ SNIPPET 2 ============ -->
	<!--
    A <script> tag with a `src` attribute loads and executes an
    external file. If the tag ALSO has content between its opening
    and closing tags, that content is IGNORED.

    For this snippet, assume external-script.js does NOT exist
    (it will fail to load). Think about what happens.
  -->

	<div id="before-external">Above</div>

	<script>
		// --- Snippet 2 ---
		console.log("E: before external");
	</script>

	<script src="nonexistent-file.js">
		// This content is between the tags of a script with src.
		console.log("F: inside src script");
	</script>

	<script>
		console.log("G: after external");
		console.log(document.getElementById("before-external").textContent);
	</script>

	<!--
    What is the full output from Snippet 2?
    Does "F: inside src script" ever execute?
    Does the failed load of nonexistent-file.js prevent "G" from running?

    // YOUR ANSWER:
    // E: before external
    // G: after external
    //
